## Project Overview  
NFL Hub is a single-page, responsive NFL tracking app built for **Software Engineering Bootcamp Project 02: Website with a Search Engine**.  
The site connects to the public **ESPN NFL API** to display live scores, full team rosters, schedules, and team information—all in one streamlined interface. A custom CSS grid and SCSS-based styling make the layout clean and mobile-friendly.

## How to Use  
- Navigate the site using the **top navigation bar** (Home, Teams, Games, About, Live Scores).  
- **Search Teams** from the navbar or the main search box to quickly filter.  
- Browse the **Teams** grid, then click **Roster** or **Schedule** on any card for detailed info.  
- Visit the **Live Now** section to check scores of currently running games.  
- Smooth scrolling and a responsive grid ensure an easy experience on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML5**  
- **SCSS / CSS3** (custom grid & responsive design)  
- **Bootstrap 5** (Lux Bootswatch theme)  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for API calls and DOM manipulation  
- **Google Fonts** – *Tourney*  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment  


## Ideas for Future Improvement  
- Add **favorite teams** for quick access.  
- Integrate **game statistics & player profiles**.  
- Provide a **dark mode** toggle for accessibility.  
- Include **historical game results & charts**.
